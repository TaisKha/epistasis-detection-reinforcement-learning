# Reinforcement learning for epistasis detection

In this repository one can find project devoted to detecting epistasis interactions between SNPs. They are algorithms based on Reinforcement learning such as DQN, REINFORCE and A2C.

Data generation scripts can be found in /extra/ directory. Data was generated with the help of EpiGen (D. B. Blumenthal, L. Viola, M. List, J. Baumbach, P. Tieri, T. Kacprowski (2020). “EpiGEN: an epistasis simulation pipeline”, Bioinformatics, DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa245)
